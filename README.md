# Cows and Bulls â€“ Number Guessing Game
Cows and Bulls is a classic logic-based guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer. After each guess, the player receives feedback in the form of "cows" and "bulls" to help narrow down the possibilities.

# Objective:
Guess the secret 4-digit number. After each guess, you'll receive:

Bull: Correct digit in the correct position

Cow: Correct digit but in the wrong position

# Gameplay Rules:
The secret number has no repeating digits.

After each guess, you'll get a count of how many digits are bulls and how many are cows.

Use logical deduction to narrow down the correct number.

The game continues until the player guesses the exact number (4 bulls).
